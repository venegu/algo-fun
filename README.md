This repository is to keep track of several different implementations of data structures and algorithms learned in class. Fun :3! 

Data Structures Projects (to date): 
   1. Circular Queue: An implementation of a queue with a circular buffer. This is ideal when handling a large number of items.
   2. Sorted Linked List: An implementation of a linked list that is sorted (in this case, sorting happens in the insert function). Linked lists are useful when one is working on something that needs easy insertion of new elements, especially if these elements need to be inserted in the front (this is not easily achievable with an array without it being O(n)). 
   3. Hash Tables
