This repository is to keep track of several different implementations of data structures and algorithms learned in class. Fun :3! 

Data Structures Projects (to date): 
   1. Circular Queue: An implementation of a queue with a circular buffer. This is ideal when handling a large number of items.
   2. Sorted Linked List: An implementation of a linked list that is sorted (in this case, sorting happens in the insert function). Linked lists are useful when new elements need to be added to a data structure, especially if these elements need to be inserted in the front of the list (this is not easily achievable with an array without it being O(n)). 
   3. Hash Tables
