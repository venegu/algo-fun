This repository is to keep track of several different implementations of data structures and algorithms learned in class. Fun :3! 

Data Structures Projects (to date): 
   1. Circular Queue: An implementation of a queue with a circular buffer. This is ideal when handling a large number of items.
   2. Sorted Linked List: An implementation of a linked list that is sorted (in this case, sorting happens in the insert function).
   3. Hash Tables
