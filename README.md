This repository is to keep track of several different implementations of data structures and algorithms learned in class. Fun :)! 

Data Structures Projects (to date): 
   1. Circular Queue: An implementation of a queue with a circular buffer. This is ideal when handling a large number of items.
   2. Linked List
